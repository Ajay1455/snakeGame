## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow in length. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the borders of the canvas or running into the snake's own body. The game becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows longer, requiring the player to strategize their movements to avoid collisions.

## Key Features

- Canvas Element: The game is built using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element, allowing for easy rendering of graphics and animations.
- Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Snake Movement: Players control the snake's movement using arrow keys (or touch controls on mobile devices), navigating it around the canvas.
- Food Generation: Random food items appear on the canvas, and when the snake consumes them, it grows longer.
- Collision Detection: The game constantly checks for collisions between the snake's head, its body, and the canvas borders, resulting in game over when necessary.
- Scoring System: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
- Game Over and Restart: When the snake collides with the borders or itself, the game ends, and players have the option to restart and try again.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. Guide the snake to consume the food items, increasing its length and score.
4. Be cautious not to run the snake into the borders or its own body, as that will result in game over.
